# Media Cleanup

A WordPress plugin intended to help clean up your website by removing unused attachments in the media library.

##### Future Releases

~~I intend to further develop this plugin to include additional features to better manage your attachments and unused media. This will include additional image sizes that aren't used, duplicate files and more.~~

I haven't been working with WordPress for a while and will only pick this up again in the future if that changes.

##### Notice

This plugin permanently deletes attachments from your website/server. Ensure you are satisfied you have selected the appropriate rules when searching for unused media. Use this plugin at your own risk, I take no responsibility for loss of data.
